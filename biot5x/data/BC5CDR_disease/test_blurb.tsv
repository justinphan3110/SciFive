In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight ( increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent ) , but most of all they found histological changes due to " regenerative " changes in the muscle tissue , which however maintained its myopathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent .

The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing steroids in experimental myopathic disease , but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field , where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility ; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis - a - vis the " regeneration " of the muscle tissue ; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin E but something as yet unknown .
