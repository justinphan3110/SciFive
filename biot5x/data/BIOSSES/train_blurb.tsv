s1: For example, loss of, or functional alterations in, the two major tumor suppressor proteins pRB and p53 cause an up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis in cancer tissues. s2: E2F1 stabilizes p53 by inducing the expression of p19(p14)/ARF, an inhibitor of the mdm2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteolysis.	2.0
s1: We found no obvious effect of LATS2-depletion on the Aurora-A kinase activity when monitored by phosphorylation state of Thr288 on Aurora-A [18] (Fig. S2), suggesting that LATS2 may be a downstream of Aurora-A as mentioned in a previous report [8] s2: Among them, miR-143, miR-145 and miR-34a have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, and miR-146a and miR-21 to increase cell growth	0.2
